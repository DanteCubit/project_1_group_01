The group will utilize data to delve into winning tournament decks within the card game Magic: The Gathering. Their aim is to discern patterns within popular decks to identify potential winning strategies.

First the DataFrame will need to be cleaned

Then, to guide the teamâ€™s investigation, they have formulated the following broad high-level questions:

1. Which colors dominate tournament decks in terms of frequency?
2. To what extent are other colors utilized?
3. What is the average converted mana cost of decks, and is there a discernible threshold?
4. How frequently do specific keywords appear in winning decks?

Several data visualizations will be generated, including a linear regression model.
